Welcome to BioBlox the game where we snap things together.

The cells in your body contain lots of tiny jigsaw pieces we call proteins.

The proteins snap together to make bigger things like your hair and fingernails.
It takes millions of proteins to make one strand of hair.

In this game we are going to learn how proteins fit together to make the tiny
machines that keep you alive and healthy.

* character goes to bottom right *

* two jigsaw pieces pop up spinning slowly with two points marked on each *

We all know how this game works: touch the parts of the jigsaw pieces that
go together.

* If the user fails to do anything after five seconds, prompt with: *

That is good, touch one place on each piece that goes with the other.

* when the user picks the correct places *

Well done. You are not a stupid as you look!

Lets try a harder puzzle.

* two lego pieces spinning slowly in 3D *

* same failure message *

* on success: *

Ok. That is good, but these are not real proteins. Real proteins look
like this:

* show trypsin *

This protein is called Trypsin. It helps you digest your food by breaking it
up into smaller pieces. But the problem with Trypsin is that given a chance
it will eat you!

* show trypsin inhibitor *

To stop it eating you, there is another protein called Trypsin inhibitor.
It snaps into Trypsin to stop it from working in the wrong place.

See if you can spot the places where the proteins go together.

Andy.
